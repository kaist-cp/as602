  + Search your question using Google and Stack Overflow before posting.
  + Describe your question in detail, including:
    - Environment (OS, and other relevant program information).

    - Any changes made to directories or files. For solution files, describe the modified code sections.
    - Your Google search results, including search terms and learned information.
